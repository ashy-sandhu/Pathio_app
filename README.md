## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathio.git
cd pathio
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Add an Android app to your Firebase project
3. Download `google-services.json` from Firebase Console
4. Place it in `android/app/google-services.json`

### 4. Google Maps API Setup

1. Get a Google Maps API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create `android/local.properties` file:
   ```properties
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Enable the following APIs in Google Cloud Console:
   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Places API (if needed)

### 5. Backend API Configuration

The app connects to a Django REST API backend. The API is currently hosted on Railway:

- **Production API**: `https://web-production-40bd5.up.railway.app`

If you want to use a different API endpoint, update `lib/core/constants/api_endpoints.dart`:

```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'your_api_url_here';
```

> **Note**: Make sure the backend API is running and accessible before running the app. The API handles all places, cities, and countries data.

### 6. Configure App Icon

Generate app icons using:
```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

---

## 🏃 Running the App

### Prerequisites

1. **Backend API**: Ensure the Django backend API is running and accessible
   - API URL: `https://web-production-40bd5.up.railway.app`
   - Or run locally if you have the API repository

2. **Firebase**: Configure Firebase as mentioned in the installation steps

3. **Google Maps**: Set up Google Maps API key

### Development Mode
